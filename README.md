# Mass-Emailer
Mass Emailer (Outdated for Gmail use)

This app reads in contact information for radio stations. I have provided a fake list to use. 

You'll also need an email template. I have provided the one I used for my band.

Please note that this is an old script I used for gmail. Gmail no longer allows the use of 3rd-party apps to login without the use of Two-factor Authentication for security purposes. If I ever needed to use this script again, I would either use a different email account that does allow 3rd party logins, or find a workaround for loggin in to the gmail account. (I'll update if I ever rework the code and put it to use.)
